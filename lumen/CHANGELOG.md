# Lumen changelog

## Build 2 (12 November 2026)

Adds Room 02 (Springs) and Room 03 (Shape morph). Rooms 04 to 06 are still placeholders.

**File:** `releases/lumen-build-2.apk`

### What is new

- **Room 02, Springs.** Two balls get exactly the same input. The top one moves the
  classic way (420 ms, ease in-out); the bottom one is a spring.
  - Tap to move the target. Tap again before it arrives.
  - Drag on empty space to drag the target around continuously.
  - Grab a ball (both are caught where they are), move it, then throw it.
  - Four spring presets: Bouncy, Natural, Snappy, Gentle. The plot under them shows
    position over time for the curve and the chosen spring.
  - Haptic tick when the spring ball settles. The curve ball gets none.
- **Room 03, Shape morph.** All shapes are hand-built and morph by blending outlines.
  - Hero shape: tap to step through eight shapes, or drag sideways to scrub; release
    and it springs to the nearest shape, with a tick when it lands.
  - Toggles: round when off, squircle when on, squeeze on press.
  - Send button: becomes a circle with a morphing loader, then a green tick, then
    returns to a pill.
  - Three loading indicators that spin while changing shape.

### What to test

1. **Springs, interruption:** tap one spot, then quickly tap another before the balls
   arrive. The top ball should visibly stop and restart; the bottom one should curve
   smoothly into the new direction. This is the whole point of the room.
2. **Springs, drag the target:** drag on empty space. The top ball should lag and crawl;
   the bottom one should follow fluidly.
3. **Springs, throw:** grab the bottom ball and flick it. It should fly in the direction
   of the flick before coming back. The top ball ignores the flick.
4. **Shape morph, scrub:** drag sideways slowly over the shape, then flick. Every
   in-between frame should be a clean outline, with no kinks or flicker.
5. **Send button:** tap it and watch the whole sequence. Does the timing feel right?
6. **Frame rate:** the Shape room keeps animating because of the loaders, so the readout
   shows fps there all the time. Note the numbers.

### Known limits

- Same as build 1: back does not follow the finger yet, settings are not remembered.

## Build 1 (12 November 2026)

First build: home screen and Room 01, Glass. Rooms 02 to 06 are placeholders.

**File:** `releases/lumen-build-1.apk`

### What is in it

- Home: bento grid of six rooms. Glass opens; the others shake to say "not yet".
- Room 01, Glass: a colourful feed with glass only on the controls.
  - Navigation bar whose selection indicator is a lens you can drag or throw.
  - Two round glass buttons (back, tune) and a tuning panel.
  - Clear-to-tinted slider, quality picker (Auto, Full, Medium, Low), solid fallback switch.
  - Four feeds. Paper is nearly white on purpose: it is the hardest case for glass.
- Settings (top right on home): theme, reduce motion, reduce transparency, glass quality, frame-rate readout.
- Frame-rate readout at the top of every screen, on by default.

### How it is built

- Flutter 3.50, Dart 3.14, `material_ui` 1.11 (no deprecated imports), Impeller.
- Glass shader, spring system and controls are hand-written. No community UI packages.
- Glass is two passes: the engine blurs what is behind the control, then the shader bends,
  tints and lights it. Quality tiers: Full (refraction, colour split, rim light), Medium
  (lighter refraction, no colour split), Low (blur and tint only), Solid (opaque).
- In Auto, quality steps down by itself if more than about 12% of frames are missed for
  two seconds running, and a notice appears above the bar.

### What to test

1. **Readout when idle.** It should say `idle · 120 Hz`. If it says 60 Hz the phone is not
   giving the app its fast display mode.
2. **Does the glass look like glass?** Rim light on the edges, content bending near the
   rim, slight colour fringes on the lens. If any glass is black, offset from its outline,
   or upside down, switch quality to Low and tell me. This is the one part verified only
   on a software renderer here, not on a real phone GPU.
3. **Drag the lens** slowly, then throw it. It should follow the finger with a little
   weight, stretch when fast, and land on a tab with one haptic tick as it settles.
4. **Scroll the feed** under the bar while watching the readout: fps and `missed`.
5. **Tune panel:** move the slider end to end; try each quality tier; try Solid fallback.
6. **Paper feed:** are the bar labels still readable over white?
7. **Open and close the room** several times, including pressing back mid-opening.
8. **Light theme and Reduce motion** in Settings.

### Known limits

- Smoothness, haptic strength and shader cost are unverified on a real device.
- Back uses the system gesture but does not yet follow the finger (that is Room 04).
- Settings are not remembered between launches.
- The readout updates about once a second; it shows `idle` when nothing is moving.
